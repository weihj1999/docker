we've always been a mail-order retailer, and I've always said that if the internet were not there, we'd have had to invent it because it is the modern version of mail-order retailing. Naturally enough, I see enormous potential in the concept. These days, of course, the entire online sector now dominates our business. Let's take a look at just the Otto company itself: in that business, we make 93 percent of our sales online, and only 7 percent via our catalogs. The reality is that these days the catalog's actually more a marketing instrument to encourage and inspire our customers to make a visit to our homepage. That's why we now have more frequent purchase monthly stimuli with new fashion, using new technology. so the right way to engage more deeply in the online world and in the digital revolution is through our website.

I am not quite convinced that drones will ever be routinely delivering packages as standard. for special situations - for example, when medicines need to be delivered out the middle of a moor - it makes sense to use a drone, but I can't really imagine millions of drones flying packages all around our cities. No, but something we are about to test is a sort of mobile parcel box that travels along sidewalks and can navigate to the front door of the customer who then uses the appropriate digitalized numbers to open the box and take delivery of the package.  This is one potential way of doing things that we'll be testing in the near future.

我们一直都是邮购零售商，而且我一直说如果互联网不存在，我们就必须发明它，因为它是邮购零售的现代版本。当然，我看到了这一概念的巨大潜力。当然，这些天来，整个在线行业现在都主导着我们的业务。让我们看一下Otto公司本身：在该业务中，我们的销售量占在线销售量的93％，而通过目录获得的销售量仅为7％。现实情况是，如今，目录实际上已成为一种营销手段，可以鼓励和激发客户访问我们的主页。因此，我们现在越来越频繁地使用新技术，新技术来购买每月刺激。因此，更深入地参与在线世界和数字革命的正确方法是通过我们的网站。

我不太相信无人机将按惯例定期交付包裹。在特殊情况下（例如，当药品需要在沼泽地中运送时），使用无人驾驶飞机是有意义的，但我真的无法想象成千上万的无人机会在我们的城市各处飞行。否，但是我们要测试的是一种可移动的包裹箱，可以沿着人行道行进，并且可以导航到客户的前门，然后客户使用适当的数字化数字来打开箱子并接收包裹。这是一种可能的方式，我们将在不久的将来进行测试。
